# SigmaTech Software
SigmaTech presents SigmaBank (name pending), an online banking website to manage your finances. SigmaBank provides a very simple and intuitive way to send money and view your financial history.

# Motivation
SigmaBank is a banking website with support for cross-country money transfers and detailed analytics. Managing money shouldn't be confusing, this app exists to help people get on top of their spending.

# Installation:
This project runs on a NODE.js backend and react frontend. Download libraries by running `npm install`. Start the application by running `npm start`. Connect at port 5000 on localhost.
Perform tests by running `npm test`.

(update this as needed)

# Contribution:
The master branch is used for product versions, representing working versions of the application. Periodic merges from the develop branch are done, but nothing else. The develop branch is used for feature additions without cluttering the master. The only changes allowed in develop are the merges from feature branches and bug fixes. Feature branches are named based on the user story they are implementing. These branches are pull requested and reviewed by a peer before being merged into the develop branch. Jira is used for ticketing issues.
