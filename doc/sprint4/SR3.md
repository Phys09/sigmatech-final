- Mark bigger issues as bugs and solve them accordingly, as opposed to marking them as stories (on Jira)
- Begin helping back-end/front-end counterpart of assigned task once that assigned task is complete
    (e.g Front-end of login is done, help back-end finish up using pair programming)
- Coordinate back-end/front-end, with corresponding counterpart before the start of the sprint to ensure completion of deliverable features

## Best/worst experience during sprint 1
