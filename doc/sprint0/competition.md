Given that our product is a banking application, other existing banking applications to be aware of include: [Bank of America’s app](https://www.bankofamerica.com/online-banking/mobile-and-online-banking-features/overview/) which immediately sends notifications of suspicious transactions, [Discover Bank’s app](https://www.discover.com/online-banking/) which has live customer support 24/7 and a basic customizable "Quick View" that won't require a full login, [Ally Bank’s app](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-banking/) and [Chime](https://www.chime.com/online-banking/) which both offer a clean, attractive, and user-friendly interface and the ability to log-in using your fingerprint, [Capital One’s app](https://www.capitalone.ca/app/) which provides a wide range of features such as freezing (and unfreezing) your debit and credit cards directly with the app, [EasyWeb](https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/solutions/ways-to-bank/online-banking/), and [Scotiabank’s app](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal/bank-your-way/app-and-online/online-banking.html).

Unlike some of the products listed above, our banking application aims to be very minimalistic by covering all of the basic features a banking app should have (such as the ability to view your balance and transaction history, make and schedule payments, transfer money to other accounts, and contact customer support) while offering a lightweight user interface where everything is easy to manage. In addition, our banking application is different by providing multiple different ways to contact customer support; users can choose between having a live chat with a bank employee or submitting a support ticket for a bank employee to resolve.

Our banking application is better suited for university/college students and older adults. With university/college students, they are constantly focused on their studies, so they cannot afford much time to learn new things outside of their studies. This becomes an issue when using a banking app that includes a lot of different functionalities (for example, Capital One) since it makes the user interface more difficult and time-consuming to navigate when the only things the student user wants to do is check their balance and make tuition payments. Meanwhile, older adults may not be too familiar with the current technology, so it is essential for a banking app to have a user interface that is easy to follow. Hence, our product is a good choice for these users as one of the main goals of our application is to make it very user-friendly.

Other competitors, specifically Bank of America, Capital One, and Scotiabank, did not focus on these users since they focused more on adding new features to attract many different users. As a result, the user interfaces of these competitors’ apps are boring and/or not user-friendly. For these competitors to focus on student and older adult users, they should consider implementing a customizable "Quick View/Manage" that only shows the basic features of a banking application (similar to the feature in Discover Bank’s app).
