# Process

## Decisions

In general, our team worked together well for sprint 0.
We made decisions by voting on them as a group. The team was organized into frontend/backend/database roles and each role performmed relevant tasks from the backlog until the end of the sprint, where roles could then be reassigned.

## User Story Prioritization

Points assigned to user stories are based on a point value system. Points were assigned based on the expected number of hours to complete the user story.
In terms of importance, high priority user stories are ones that describe scenarios that most users as well as any that are required in order for that to happen.

## Meetings

We used our discord group chat to announce and hold our group meetings. We met every couple days, or when needed. One issue we encountered was some of our meetings being too long, we learned in this sprint to do more work individually inorder to avoid unproductive long meetings.

In general, this sprint went well and if we continue working the way we have we should be able to do well on this project. Pair programming will also be a useful asset in the development process.

## Lessons for the Future

The main lessons to keep in mind moving forward are as follows.
- Have a planned out meeting outline.
- Try to do more work individually to reduce the time spent in meetings, doing work.
- Expect that meetings (and other things) may end up taking longer than expected.
