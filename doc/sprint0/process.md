Our team worked together well for sprint 0. We used our discord group chat to announce and hold our group meetings. We made decisions by voting on them as a group. TODO Points of user story comment. We met every couple days. One issue we encountered was some of our meetings being too long, we learned in this sprint to do more work individually inorder to avoid unproductive long meetings. In general, this sprint went well and if we continue working the way we have we should be able to do well on this project.
